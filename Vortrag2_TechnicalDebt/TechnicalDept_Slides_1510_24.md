How tools like *NDepend* can help single teams developers to reduce their technical dept

This presentation first explains in simple words the term _technical dept_ and shows a few example where code produces such a debt.

In the second part the commercial tool *NDepend* is used to address technical dept issues by not only calculating the dept of a complete project but also allow to follow the development of the dept either for the complete project or for single methods over a period of time.

The presentation shows several examples of how to use the *NDepend* API to measure metrics like dept with X#.

**note**: Although X# is official not supported by *NDepend* (only C# and VB) most of the analysis can be done with X# as well since the analysis is done on the assembly level. Some exceptions are the use of comments and everything else that is based on the source code. The *NDepend* API can be completely used with X# too.
