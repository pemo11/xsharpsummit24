# XSharpSummit2024

This repo contains the slides and the examples for my two presentations at the **X# Summit 2024**:

1. Getting out of technical dept - with NDepend and other tools
2. PowerShell as the X# developers new friend

The original title of the PowerShell presentation contained "best friend" but thats a bit exagareted. Visual Studio or XIDE should be our best friend or may be a dbf editor or may be Ultraedit32. And of course you have to have real friends.

As a little distraction and if you use _ChatGPT_. Please ask your AI friend the following question:

"Whats the best friend of a software developer?"

_ChatGPT_ lists six best friends:

1. Version Control Systems (VCS) - Git
2. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
3. Stack Overflow (and other developer communities)
4. Documentation
5. Automation Tools
6. Coffee (or any preferred source of energy)

Yes, of course. I have always wanted to make _git_ my best friend but have not succeed that much. But I keep trying.

And, yes, coffee (I recommend KoffieHenk, or Kaffee Henk in German, as your dealer of choice;). A cup stands right in front of me while writing this text. How did the "machine" know all this?

_ChatGPT_ says this about the effect of coffee:

"caffeine helps boost alertness and focus, which can be essential when debugging or writing complex code late into the night"

Of course, one new friend is missing from the list.

Please think about it for a second or two.

Who can it be? Who can it be?

Its AI of course. Everybodys new best friend.

_ChatGPT_ list several reasons why AI is the developers friend and they are all valid:

1. Code Assistance and Autocompletion
2. Bug Detection and Debugging
3. Testing Automation
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Documentation
5. Code Refactoring
6. Project Management and Issue Tracking
7. Learning and Skill Development
8. AI in Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

But back to the topic of my presentation.

PowerShell can be one of your best friends.

I couldn't resist asking this question too:

"How can PowerShell be the best friend of a developer?"

Again, _ChatGPT_ listed several valid reasons:

1. Automation and Scripting
2. Integration with DevOps Tools
3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
4. Object-Oriented Pipeline
5. Easy Access to .NET Framework
6. Development and Debugging Tools
7. Community and Ecosystem
8. Efficient Task Management

Points 1, 4 and 5 are most important.

And now, I couldn't resist asking this question too:

"Can you please make an presentation out of this list and add some examples for topics 1, 4 and 5"

Of course it can, but _ChatGPT_ generated only text. So

"I meant a PowerPoint presentation"

This time _ChatGPT_ did not answer with "of course" but generated a PowerPoint presentation that I could download.

It turned out, that the presentation included only topics 1, 4 und 5. So another round:

"Yery good, but please include all topics with examples"

This time the presentation contained ten slides.

It not perfect of course, it has no formatting and the examples are little to simple, but its a complete and consistent presentation that I could use as a "plan B" just in case I would have absolutely no time to prepare something.

And all too in less than 1 minute.

**disclaimer**: I know of course about the giant power and water consumption of modern AI data centers run by Amazon, Google, Microsoft etc. I have read that each query consumes 0.5l of water. I have been to Corfu in Septemer and heard that they had a dry summer on this green island and people are ask to save water (not the tourist of course) and the water supply will be reduced at night. So, this a serious issue and the question for me is who might have to pay a heavy price for using our new "AI friends" when we ask sometimes real stupid questions? (not the like I was asking of course;)

**tip:** If you ever will ask your AI friend to do a presentation for you, don't forget to let "him" include some typos;)
